- Declare and invoke functions appropriately.
- Work with basic and complex data types like arrays and objects.

### AJAX Basics

- Handle asynchronous code using `try`/`catch` blocks within async functions.
- Update the DOM with data request results.

### Front-End Basics

- Develop well-structured React components.

- Implement event listeners on React components.
- Manage state and effects proficiently.
- Set up routes using React Router.

### CSS Basics
